* TODO Introduction
Automatic Speech Recognition is a subset of Machine Translation that takes a sequence of raw audio information and translates or matches it against the most likely sequence of text as would be interpreted by a human language expert.  In this thesis, Automatic Speech Recognition will also be referred to as 
ASR or speech recognition for short.

It can be argued that while ASR has achieved excellent performance in specific applications, much is left to be desired for general purpose speech recognition. While commercial applications like google voice search and Apple Siri gives evidence that this gap is closing, there is still yet other areas within this research space that speech recognition task is very much an unsolved problem.

It is estimated that there are close to 7000 human languages in the world and yet for only a fraction of this number have there been efforts made towards ASR.  The recognition rates that have been so far achieved are based on large quantities of speech data and other linguistic resources used to train models for ASR. These models which depend largely on pattern recognition techniques degrade tremendously  when applied to different languages other than the languages that they were trained or designed for.  In addition due to the fact that collection of sufficient amounts of linguistic resources required to create accurate models for ASR are particularly laborious and time consuming to collect often extending to decades, it is therefore wise to considerIn addition due to the fact that collection of sufficient amounts of linguistic resources required to create accurate models for ASR are particularly laborious and time consuming to collect often extending to decades, it is therefore wise to consider alternative approaches towards developing systems for Automatic Speech Recognition in languages lacking the resources required to build ASR systems using existing mechanisms.

** TODO ASR as a Machine Learning  problem \label{ASRMLP}
Automatic speech recognition can be put into a class of machine learning problems described as sequence pattern recognition because ASR attempts to discriminate a pattern from the seqeuence of speech utterances. 

One immediate problem realised with this definition leads us to a statistical speech models that describes how to handle this problem described in the following paragraph.

Speech is a complex phenomena that begins as a cognitive process and ends up as a physical process.  The process of automatic speech recognition attempts to retrace the steps back from the physical process to the cognitive process giving rise to latent variables or mismatched data or loss of information from interpreting speech from one physiological layer to the next.

It has been acknowledged in the research community \citep{2015watanabe,deng2013machine}  that work being done in Machine Learning has enhanced the research of automatic speech recognition.  Similarly any progress made in ASR usually constitutes a contribution to enhances made in machine learning algorithm.  This also is an attribution to the fact that speech recogntion is a sequence pattern recogntion problem.  Therefore techniques within speech recognition could be applied generally to sequence pattern recognition problems.

The two main approaches to machine learning problems historically involve two methods rooted in statistical science.  These approaches are the generative and discriminitative models.  From a computing science perspective, the generative approach is a bruteforce approach while the discriminative model is the more heuristic method to machine learning. This chapter establishes the basic definitions of these two approaches in order to introduce the reasoning behind the methods used in this research for low resource speech recognition as well as introduces the Wakirike language speech recogniser as the motivating language under study.  As this research investigates, the although the generative process is able to generate arbitrary outputs, its major draw back is the direct relation to the training data from which the model parameters are learned. Specific characteristics of various machine learning models are reserved for later chapters albeit the heuristic nature of the discriminative approach gains over the generative approach being able to better compensate the latent variables of speech data often lost in training data during the transformation from one physiological layer of abstraction to the next as discussed in section \ref{ASRMLP}.

** TODO Generative Speech Models disambiguation
In the next chapter, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM), is examined as a powerful and major driver behind generative modeling of sequential data like speech.  Generative models are data-sensitive models because they are derived from the data by accumulating as many different features which can be seen and make generalisations based on the features seen. The discriminative model, on the other hand, has a heuristic approach to make classification.  Rather than using features of the data directly, the discriminative method attempts to characterise the data into features. It is possible to conclude that the generative approach uses a bottom-to-top strategy starting with the fundamental structures to determine the overall structure, while the discriminative method uses a top-to-bottom approach starting with the big picture and then drilling down to discover the fundamental structures.

Ultimately the generative models for machine learning learning can be interpreted mathematically as a joint distribution that produces the highest likelihood of outputs and inputs based on a predefined decision function.  The outputs for speech recognition being the sequence of words and the inputs for speech being the audio wave form or equivalent speech sequence.

\begin{equation}d_y(\mathbf{x};\lambda)=p(\mathbf{x},y;\lambda)=p(\mathbf{x}|y;\lambda)p(y;\lambda)\label{eqn1_1}
\end{equation}

where $$d_y(\mathbf{x};\lambda)$$ is the decision function of $$y$$ for data labels $$\mathbf{x}$$.  This joint probability expression given as $$p(\mathbf{x}|y;\lambda)$$ can also be expressed as the conditional probability product in equation_ref.  In this above equation, lambda predefines the nature of the distribution \cite{2013Deng***} referred to as model parameters.

Similarly, machine learning discriminative models are described mathematically as the conditional probability defined by the generic decision function below:
\begin{equation}
d_y(\mathbf{x};\lambda)=p(y|\mathbf{x};\lambda)
\end{equation}

It is clearly seen that the discriminative paradigm is a much simpler and straight forward paradigm and indeed is the chosen paradigm for this study.  However, what the discriminative model gains in discriminative simplicity it loses in model parameter estimation ($$\lambda$$) in equation (\ref{eqn1_1}) and (\ref{eqn1_2).

** Low Resource Languages
 As this research investigates, the although the generative process is able to generate arbitrary outputs, its major draw back is the direct relation to the training data from which the model parameters are learned. Specific characteristics of various machine learning models are reserved for later chapters albeit the heuristic nature of the discriminative approach gains over the generative approach being able to better compensate the latent variables of speech data often lost in training data during the transformation from one physiological layer of abstraction to the next as discussed in section \ref{ASRMLP}.  This rationale is reinforced from the notion of deep learning defined in \cite{deng2014deep} as an attempt to learn patterns from data at multiple levels of abstraction. Thus while shallow machine learning models like hidden Markov models (HMMs) define latent variables for fixed layers of abstraction, deep machine learning models handle hidden/latent information for arbitrary layers of abstraction determined heuristically.  As deep learning are typically implemented using deep neural networks, this work applies deep recurrent neural networks as an end-to-end discriminative classifier, to speech recognition.  This is a so called "an end-to-end model" because it adopts the top-to-bottom machine learning approach. Unlike the typical generative classifiers that require sub-word acoustic models, the end-to-end models develop algorithms at higher levels of abstraction as well as the lower levels of abstraction.  In the case of the deep-speech model \citep{hannun2014first} used in this research, the levels of abstraction include sentence/phrase, words and character discrimination. A second advantage of the end-to-end model is that because the traditional generative models require various stages of modeling including an acoustic, language and lexicon, the end-to-end discriminating multiple levels of abstractions simultaneously only requires a single stage process, greatly reducing the amount of resources required for speech recognition.  From a low resource language perspective this is an attractive feature meaning that the model can be learned from an acoustic only source without the need of an acoustic model or a phonetic dictionary.  In theory this deep learning technique is sufficient in itself without a language model.  However, applying a language model was found to serve as a correction factor further improving recognition results citep{hannun2014deep}. 


** The Wakirike Language
The Wakirike municipality is a fishing community comprising 13 districts in the Niger Delta area of the country of Nigeria in the West African region of the continent of Africa.  Okrika migrants settled at the Okrika mainland between AD860 at the earliest AD1515.  Earliest settlers migrated from Central and Western Niger Delta.  When the second set of settlers met the first set of settlers they exclaimed “we are not different” or “Wakirike” \citep{wakirike}.  Although the population of the Wakirike community from a 1995 report \citep{ethnologue} is about 248,000, the speaker base is  much less than that.  The language is classified as Niger-Congo and Ijoid languages.  The writing orthography is latin and the language status is 5 (developing) \citep{ethnologue}.  This means that although the language is not yet an endangered language, it still isn't thriving and it is being passed on to the next generation at a limited rate.

The Wakirike language was the focus for this research.  And End-to-end deep neural network language model was built for the Wakirike language based on the availability of the new testament bible printed edition that was available for processing.  The corpus utilized for this thesis work was about 9,000 words.

Due to limiations in transcribed speech for the Wakirike language, English was substituted and used for the final speech model.  The English language was used as a control variable to measure accuracy of speech recognition for differing spans of speech data being validated against on algorithms developed in this research.

** Thesis outline
The outline of this report follows the development of an end-to-end speech recogniser and develops the theory based on the building blocks of the final system.  Chapter two introduces the speech recognition pipeline and the generative speech model.  Chapter two outlines the weaknesses in the generative model and describes some of the machine learning techniques applied to improve speech recognition performance. 

Low speech recognition are reviewed and the relevance of this study is also highlighted.  Chapter three describes Recurrent neural networks beginning from multi-layer perceptrons and probabilistic sequence models.  Specialised recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and the Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) used to develop the language model for the Wakirike language.

Chapter Four explains the wavelet theorem as well as the deep scattering spectrum. The chapter develops the theory from fourier transform and details the the significance of using the scattering transform as a feature selection mechanism for low resource recognition.  

Chapters five and six is a description of the models developed by this thesis and details the experiment setup along with the results obtained. Chapters seven is a discussioin of the result and chapter 8 are the recommendations for further study.
